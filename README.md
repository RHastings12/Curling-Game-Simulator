# Curling-Game-Simulator
This is a simple 2D top-down curling game simulator. Made with pygame.<br><br>

### Rules
* The game lasts eight ends, with extra ends in the event of a tie. * On game start, the ice conditions are randomized so the player(s) will not know how fast/slow or straight/curly the ice will be until a rock has been thrown. * The starting colour is also randomized by a 50/50 coin flip. * If a rock stops before or on the far hog line, it will be taken out of play unless it makes contact with another rock first. * If ANY rock touches the sides of the sheet (top/bottom from the player's perspective) that rock will be taken out of play.

S - Increase counterclockwise rotation<br>
